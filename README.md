This Project focusses on the safety of the driver by alerting him before. We use TSR ( Traffic Sign Recognition )

## Traffic Signs recognition


Train and classify Traffic Signs using Convolutional neural networks This will be done using  OPENCV in real time using a thermographic webcam .CNNs have been gaining popularity in the past couple of years due to their ability to generalize and classify the data with high accuracies. In this we will train traffic signs with over 35000 images of 43 different classes.
